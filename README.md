## A Fully Functional Photo-gallery Project Created using HTML, CSS, and JS Library.

This is a photo gallery project that was birthed from my desire to put my HTML and CSS knowledge to the text but ended up requiring knowledge that was beeyond my skill set.

This project was initially embarked on to put my HTML and CSS skills to the test by ended up leading me to explore the land of JavaScript Libraries. 
It is a persoanl project I embarked on to help create a way to share a gallery made up of images that were created by myslef, and my peers during our undergraduate days.
The project taught me the following:

* How to better use flexbox.
* Expanded my knowlege on the background CSS property
* How to utilize JS Libraries - Lightbox2.
* Image optimization
* Flexibility in project building
* Project deployment
* Expanded my knowledge on Git and GitHub.
